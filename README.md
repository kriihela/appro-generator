# appro-generator

Appro generator is the final project of Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences' mobile programming course.

The purpose of the app is to automatically create a bar orienteering event for college students, known as appros.

In the application, the starting place, the size of the area and the number of performance places (bars) are selected. The app will automatically create a route after this.

Always new appros to experience! Drink responsibly!
